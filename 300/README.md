# 300 - Building Our Application

[![Deploy to Render](http://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

## alternative: docker compose
you can also use docker compose if you'd rather avoid setting up a render.com account

`docker-compose up`
and in a separate terminal (if you created an extension with `npm init directus-extension` [docs](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/creating-extensions.html) )

`cd YOUR_EXTENSION; npm run dev`
